📊 Results & Key Insights

Overall Churn Severity
The analysis revealed an overall churn rate of 44.8%, indicating that nearly half of the customer base has discontinued service. This level of attrition represents significant risk to recurring revenue and long-term business sustainability.

Satisfaction as a Key Churn Driver
A strong inverse relationship was identified between customer satisfaction and churn. Customers with satisfaction scores of 1–3 exhibited nearly 100% churn, while churn rates dropped significantly at satisfaction levels 4 and 5. This suggests customer satisfaction is the strongest predictor of retention within the dataset.

Regional Churn Patterns
Churn rates varied across regions, indicating that geographic factors may influence customer behavior. Certain regions demonstrated higher churn concentration and should be prioritized for targeted retention strategies.

Revenue Exposure
With an average monthly spend of $46.62 per customer, the 44.8% churn rate represents substantial recurring revenue loss. Even modest improvements in retention could materially improve financial stability.

💡 Business Recommendations

Proactive Retention Strategy
Implement early-warning systems to identify customers with satisfaction scores ≤3 and intervene before churn occurs.

Targeted Regional Interventions
Develop region-specific retention initiatives in areas with elevated churn rates.

Customer Experience Improvements
Invest in service enhancements to move customers from satisfaction level 3 to 4+, where churn decreases significantly.

Continuous Monitoring
Track churn and satisfaction trends monthly to measure the effectiveness of retention initiatives.
